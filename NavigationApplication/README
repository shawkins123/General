Program Concept:
This program is meant to simulate an application on a mobile phone for a visually impaired person to use
it is a functional prototype and is only meant as a visual demonstration 

//-----------------------------------------------------//

Program Instructions and Layout:
start the program, and you will be taken to screen 1
Screen One contains two sections -
The left hand side is a representation of a loading screen of the application on the phone
the right hand side is the developer testing suite 
Screen One is meant only to load the program - if it cannot gain access to the necessary data
(i.e. it cannot connect to the phone's GPS unit), then the loading screen will alert the user of
a failure
the buttons on this screen allow you to continue or exit the program.
Once the button has been selected to continue, Screen Two is brought up
Again, the left hand side represents the screen of the phone and the right hand side is the 
developer testing suite
The UI includes: a map, which will give voice directions to its users,
a button signaling a connection to the GPS/internet is ongoing, and a button to contact emergency services
users can also state they want to contact emergency services aloud via voice command
To run through the program, first put the filepath of the images ('finalproj') in the text box, then select 'Set File Path'
The destination is hard-coded in this prototype. 
Select Confirm destination - the application will verify with the user that their current location is correct
Select Enter Destination - a destination will be given via voice command
Select Get Directions - the application will send directions to the user via voice module and a map will be displayed 
the screen.
The Progess bar is for developers and indicates the stage the prototype has advanced to
Select Repeat Directions at any time to hear the latest set of directions to reach the destination
Select Cancel Directions at any time to cancel the current set of directions.
Select Emergency Call to notify emergency personnel of a situation. The application pings emergency personnel with 
your location even if you are unable to speak.
Select Exit to exit the program.
